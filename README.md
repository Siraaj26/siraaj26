## 👋 About Me

I'm **Siraaj Jeftha**, a passionate **Software Engineer** and **WeThinkCode_ graduate** who thrives on turning complex problems into elegant solutions. My journey in technology is driven by curiosity and a strong commitment to continuous learning.

I believe in crafting software that not only works reliably but also creates meaningful impact. I enjoy building applications that balance solid backend design with intuitive, user-friendly interfaces.

Currently I am focused on developing **Horizon LMS**, an **E-Commerce Platform**, and a **Real-Time Chat App**, while strengthening my expertise in **Java, React, Docker, and Node.js**, and learning **Next.js and TypeScript**.

---

## 🧠 What I Do

I enjoy leading teams, getting things done, and keeping processes running smoothly even when the path gets a little bumpy. I value collaboration and enjoy working with like-minded people to build better solutions together.

If we can ship quality software and avoid total chaos along the way, we are doing it right.

## 🎤 Fun Fact

Debugging is my kind of therapy. I talk to my computer, it mostly ignores me,  
and sometimes I think, "Yes! It works!" — only to realise, nope, it only works on my machine.  
Then I spend the next hour figuring out if it is magic, luck or just me overthinking things.
